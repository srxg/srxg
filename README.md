### Hey ðŸ‘‹ This is my new GitHub account!
### In case you are a recruiter seeking my university projects, please note that due to academic integrity guidelines, I am unable to share them publicly.

- ðŸ”­ Right now, I'm studying for exams and co-authoring a research paper for CiE
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to get into embedded systems development, kernel stuff, os-dev stuff, wireless chip stuff looks cool too (firmware engineering).
- ðŸ¤ž  When University work settles down, I'm hoping to write 802.11n firmware for the RTL8710AF from scratch, a basic 32-bit kernel in C for x86, and a real-time operating system for ARM (to get my foot in the door). Might buy a Oneplus 7 or 8(T) and start contributing to Postmarket OS. I've got an FPGA laying around, maybe I'll use that to drive VGA, then HDMI. If I enjoy the FPGA stuff, I'll probably look into implementing a soft cpu.
- ðŸ¤” Will start teaching myself electronics/electrical engineering soon, too.
