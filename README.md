### Hey ðŸ‘‹ This is my new GitHub account!
### In case you are a recruiter seeking my university projects, please note that due to academic integrity guidelines, I am unable to share them publicly.

- ðŸ”­ Right now, I'm studying for exams, working on my Dissertation and finishing Courseworks
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to get into embedded systems development, considering contributing to the mobile linux sphere...it would be cool to contribute to the Monero project too :p
- ðŸ¤ž  When University work settles down, I'm hoping to write a basic 32-bit kernel in C for x86, to get my foot in the door. I'll probably buy a Oneplus 7 or 8(T) and start contributing to Postmarket OS. I've got an FPGA laying around, maybe I'll use that to drive VGA, then HDMI. If I enjoy the FPGA stuff, I'll probably look into implementing a soft cpu.
- ðŸ¤” I also wanna make a cheap CO2 monitor
